After studying the properties of charcoal in an academic setting regarding absorption of toxins in water filtration, I decided to pick this aluminum free deodorant. A few years earlier, I tried other aluminum free deodorants and they failed miserably. It smells good, with a mineraly fresh scent. I have sensitive skin, especially after shaving. After going to the dermatologist because I thought I had a serious rash with a burning sensation, we figured it was this deodorant. Now I know not to apply this deodorant the day or two after shaving. I reccomend this if you do not shave often. Also, it does stain gray and oily. Do not wear this on thin, light, or nice clothes. Good for wearing with neutral colored sweaters, for example. As for sweat prevention and odor reduction, it was satisfactory. I live in the northeast US, where we have cold winters and humid hot summers, so it was good for fall, winter and spring. Definitely did not do the job in summer. Also not as effective during exercise. Overall, this was a good alternative to aluminum antiperspirant when I am wearing thicker clothes I do not care about too much, in the colder months, when I am not exercising, and when I have not shaved for a day or two.

I have been wanting to find a good non-aluminum deodorant. I've used Dove for years with no problem, but I've read that non-aluminum deodorants are better for you.

No way to rinse it off or apply any cream. By the time I got home from work, I was in agony. My skin felt so burned and scraped, and every time my arm moved across it sent a new sear of pain. I got my shirt off and looked at my underarms and they were so red and raw looking. I hadn't shaved (the deodorant advises against it), so that wasn't the issue.

We started with a layer of our Sea Salt Caramel, added a layer of chocolatey cookies for a delicious crunch and created a third layer with our dulce de leche, added more Sea Salt Gelato and finally finished with a fifth layer of chocolatey caramel truffles. Because we used all of the same ingredients from our Talenti Sea Salt Caramel PLUS more, This Layers is the ultimate decadence and a caramel lovers dream. At Talenti, we believe the best process and highest quality ingredients results in the best tasting gelato and sorbetto. We start with fresh milk and cream and make each flavor from scratch with the highest-quality ingredients sourced from all around the world. We then use an old world process that involves slow cooking our ingredients in smaller batches to bring out unique flavors for a one-of-a-kind dessert. We package our gelato in clear, BPA-free jars to showcase the beautiful gelato inside. When you’re done, recycle or reuse* the jar anyway you like. In addition to Talenti Gelato Layers, Talenti has Dairy-Free Sorbettos, USDA Certified Organic Gelato, flavors that are gluten-free and/or vegan, Gelato with less sugar and our classic Gelato. All of our gelatos are made with non-GMO sourced ingredients.** Try all of our flavors and discover why Talenti is Crafted for Taste, Clearly Talenti. *Talenti jars are not microwave or dishwasher safe.
